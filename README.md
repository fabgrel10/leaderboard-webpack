## Built With

- [Webpack 5](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - _JavaScript_ module bundler.
- [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass) compiler based on Dart `sass`.
- [Babel 7](https://github.com/babel/babel) (`@babel/core`) - JavaScript compiler - _Use next generation JavaScript, today._

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- `node` : `^12 || >=14`
- `npm`

### Setup

1. Download or fork this project
2. Extract the release archive to a new directory, rename it to your project name and browse the directory.
3. Install all dependencies using `npm` _clean install_ command.

```sh
npm ci
```

More on the clean install npm command can be read here [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html)
You can still use `npm install` in cases the `npm ci` raises system error due to specific platform incompatibilities.

## Configuration

### Environment Configuration

- Edit the [`configuration/environment.js`](configuration/environment.js) if you want to specify:
  - **`server`**: configure development server, specify `host`, `port`. Refer to the full development server configuration options for [`webpack-dev-server`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).
  - **`limits`**: configure file size thresholds for assets optimizations.
    - Image/Font files size in bytes. Below this value the image file will be served as Data URL (_inline base64_).
  - **`paths`**: `src` or `dist` directories names and file system location.

### Additional `webpack` configuration

You can additionally configure `webpack` for specific environment:

- `development` - [`configuration/webpack.dev.config.js`](configuration/webpack.dev.config.js)
- `production` - [`configuration/webpack.prod.config.js`](configuration/webpack.prod.config.js)
  - Note that if you prefer to build and deploy [`sourcemap`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#production) files:
    > You should configure your server to disallow access to the Source Map file for normal users!

## Build Assets: Development

### One time build assets for development

```sh
npm run build
```

### Build assets and enable source files watcher

```sh
npm run watch
```

### Start a development server - reloading automatically after each file change

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Build Assets: Production

Optimize assets for production by:

```sh
npm run production
```
